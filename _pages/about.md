### About me

I'm a Computing Engineer, doing my PhD studies at Universidad Nacional del Litoral, Santa Fe, Argentina. In particular, I work at sinc(i), the Research institute for signals, systems and computational intelligence, on topics such as Graph CNNs applied to medical imaging and automatic plant root phenotyping using deep learning.

I'm now a chief of practical works (JTP in Argentina) at the Facultad de Ingeniería Química, teaching Informatics on the first semester. On the second semester, I'm a teaching assistant in the Deep Learning course at the Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Hídricas (both in the Universidad Nacional del Litoral).

### About the lab (https://sinc.unl.edu.ar)

Research at sinc(i) aims to develop new algorithms for machine learning, data mining, signal processing and complex systems, providing innovative technologies for advancing healthcare, bioinformatics, precision agriculture, autonomous systems and human-computer interfaces. Research facilities are located in the Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Hídricas building, Universidad Nacional del Litoral, on the University Campus.
