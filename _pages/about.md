I am a Computing Engineer from Argentina, currently specializing in the field of computer vision, graph neural networks, and deep learning. In May 2020, I received my degree from the [Facultad de Ingeniería y Ciencias Hídricas](http://fich.unl.edu.ar) at the [Universidad Nacional del Litoral](https://unl.edu.ar) (UNL), Santa Fe, Argentina. Upon completion, I secured a [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/) scholarship to embark on my PhD journey at the same university.

My research work is based at [sinc(i)](https://sinc.unl.edu.ar/), the Research Institute for Signals, Systems and Computational Intelligence. Here, I work under the direct supervision of [Enzo Ferrante](https://eferrante.github.io), contributing to cutting-edge developments in our field. My research often intersects with medical imaging, with key projects focusing on advanced segmentation techniques and leveraging deep learning for high throughput phenotyping of plant roots.

In addition to my research work, I am passionate about educating the next generation of engineers and researchers. This passion is realized through my role as a teaching assistant at the [Facultad de Ingeniería Química](https://fiq.unl.edu.ar), UNL. Depending on the semester, I assist in teaching courses such as Informatics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

## **Latest News**

- **1st September 2023**: Our latest paper "Unsupervised bias discovery in medical image segmentation", accepted for publication at Fairness in AI in Medical Imaging - MICCAI 2023 Workshop, is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00451).
